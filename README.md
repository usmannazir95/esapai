## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd esapai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# ============================================
# SERVER-SIDE ONLY (NOT exposed to browser)
# ============================================
# These variables are NEVER prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# They are only available in API routes and server components

# Security - Arcjet (REQUIRED for production)
# Get your API key from https://arcjet.com
# ⚠️ SECRET: Never expose this to the browser
ARCJET_KEY=your_arcjet_api_key_here

# Sanity CMS - Read Token (REQUIRED)
# ⚠️ SECRET: Never expose this to the browser
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=your_read_token

# Contact Form - Web3Forms (REQUIRED)
# Get your access key from https://web3forms.com
# ⚠️ SECRET: Never expose this to the browser
WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_web3forms_access_key

# ============================================
# CLIENT-SIDE (Exposed to browser via NEXT_PUBLIC_)
# ============================================
# These variables are safe to expose publicly
# Vercel will show a warning - this is expected and safe for these values

# Sanity CMS - Project ID (REQUIRED)
# ✅ SAFE: Sanity project IDs are public identifiers
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Sanity CMS - Dataset (REQUIRED)
# ✅ SAFE: Dataset name is public (e.g., "production")
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production

# Google Analytics (OPTIONAL)
# ✅ SAFE: Google Analytics IDs are meant to be public
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your_ga_id

# Next.js Configuration (OPTIONAL)
# ✅ SAFE: Site URL is public information
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

**Security Notes:**
- **Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for secrets**: API keys, tokens, and access keys must NOT be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- **Vercel Warning**: Vercel will warn about `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables - this is expected. All our `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are safe to expose (project IDs, public URLs, etc.)
- **Server-side secrets**: `ARCJET_KEY`, `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`, and `WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` are server-side only and never exposed to the browser
- **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control
- **Use different keys** for development and production
- **Rotate keys regularly** for security

4. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
